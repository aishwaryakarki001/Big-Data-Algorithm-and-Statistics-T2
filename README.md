Perform each step in R and then in Python.
1.	Use the dataset(csv) provided.  Read it into memory (for R use “data <- read.csv(‘data.csv’)” and for Python use “data = pd.read_csv('data.csv')” .  It should contain at least 10 records and 2 attributes.  One attribute should is “A” and the other “B”.
2.	Using functions to calculate and print the mean, mode, median, trimmed mean (10%), variance and standard deviation of both attributes.
3.	Calculate the IQR of each attribute.
4.	Create a boxplot and histogram (for attribute A bins should be (0 to <0.2, 0.2  to <0.4, 0.4 to <0.6, 0.6 to <0.8 and 0.8 to 1) and for attribute B bins should be (0 to <5, 5  to <10, 10 to <15, 15 to 20)).
5.	Produce a scatter plot of A to B.
